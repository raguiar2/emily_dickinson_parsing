the props assist the house

Until the house is built,

And then the props withdraw—

And adequate, erect,

The house supports itself;        

Ceasing to recollect

The auger and the carpenter.

Just such a retrospect

Hath the perfected life,

A past of plank and nail,        

And slowness,—then the scaffolds drop—

Affirming it a soul.
