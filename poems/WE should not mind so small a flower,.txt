WE should not mind so small a flower,

Except it quiet bring

Our little garden that we lost

Back to the lawn again.

So spicy her Carnations red,        

So drunken reel her Bees,

So silver steal a hundred Flutes

From out a hundred trees,

That whoso sees this little flower,

By faith may clear behold        

The Bobolinks around the throne,

And Dandelions gold.
