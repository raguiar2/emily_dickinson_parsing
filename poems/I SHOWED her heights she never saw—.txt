I SHOWED her heights she never saw—

“Wouldst climb?” I said,

She said “Not so”—

“With me?” I said, “With me?”

I showed her secrets        

Morning’s nest,

The rope that Nights were put across—

And now, “Wouldst have me for a Guest?”

She could not find her yes—

And then, I brake my life, and Lo!        

A light for her, did solemn glow,

The larger, as her face withdrew—

And could she, further, “No?”
