THE BIBLE is an antique volume

Written by faded men,

At the suggestion of Holy Spectres—

Subjects—Bethlehem—

Eden—the ancient Homestead—        

Satan—the Brigadier,

Judas—the great Defaulter,

David—the Troubadour.

Sin—a distinguished Precipice

Others must resist,        

Boys that “believe”

Are very lonesome—

Other boys are “lost.”

Had but the tale a warbling Teller

All the boys would come—        

Orpheus’ sermon captivated,

It did not condemn.
