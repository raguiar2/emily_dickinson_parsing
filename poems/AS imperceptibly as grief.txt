as imperceptibly as grief

The summer lapsed away,—

Too imperceptible, at last,

To seem like perfidy.

  

A quietness distilled,        

As twilight long begun,

Or Nature, spending with herself

Sequestered afternoon.

  

The dusk drew earlier in,

The morning foreign shone,—        

A courteous, yet harrowing grace,

As guest who would be gone.

  

And thus, without a wing,

Or service of a keel,

Our summer made her light escape        

Into the beautiful.
