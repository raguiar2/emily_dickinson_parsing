TWO LENGTHS has every day,

Its absolute extent—

And area superior

By hope or heaven lent.

Eternity will be        

Velocity, or pause,

At fundamental signals

From fundamental laws.

To die, is not to go—

On doom’s consummate chart        

No territory new is staked,

Remain thou as thou art.
