blazing in gold and quenching in purple,

Leaping like leopards to the sky,

Then at the feet of the old horizon

Laying her spotted face, to die;

  

Stooping as low as the kitchen window,        

Touching the roof and tinting the barn,

Kissing her bonnet to the meadow,—

And the juggler of day is gone!
