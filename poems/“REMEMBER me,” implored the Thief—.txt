“remember me,” implored the thief—

Oh magnanimity!

“My Visitor in Paradise

I give thee Guaranty.”

  

That courtesy will fair remain,        

When the delight is dust,

With which we cite this mightiest case

Of compensated Trust.

  

Of All, we are allowed to hope,

But Affidavit stands        

That this was due, where some, we fear,

Are unexpected friends.
