the luxury to apprehend

The luxury ’t would be

To look at thee a single time,

An Epicure of me,

In whatsoever Presence, makes,        

Till, for a further food

I scarcely recollect to starve,

So first am I supplied.

The luxury to meditate

The luxury it was        

To banquet on thy Countenance,

A sumptuousness bestows

On plainer days,

Whose table, far as

Certainty can see,        

Is laden with a single crumb—

The consciousness of Thee.
