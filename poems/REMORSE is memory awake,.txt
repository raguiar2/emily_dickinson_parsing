remorse is memory awake,

Her companies astir,—

A presence of departed acts

At window and at door.

  

Its past set down before the soul,        

And lighted with a match,

Perusal to facilitate

Of its condensed despatch.

  

Remorse is cureless,—the disease

Not even God can heal;        

For ’t is His institution,—

The complement of hell.
