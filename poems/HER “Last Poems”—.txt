her “last poems”—

Poets ended,

Silver perished with her tongue,

Not on record bubbled other

Flute, or Woman, so divine;        

Robin uttered half the tune—

Gushed too free for the adoring,

From the Anglo-Florentine.

Late the praise—

’T is dull conferring        

On a Head too high to crown,

Diadem or Ducal showing,

Be its Grave sufficient sign.

Yet if we, no Poet’s Kinsman,

Suffocate with easy woe,        

What and if ourself a Bridegroom,

Put Her down, in Italy?(Written after the death of Mrs. Browning in .)
