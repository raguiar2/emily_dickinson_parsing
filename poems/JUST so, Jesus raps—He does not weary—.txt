JUST so, Jesus raps—He does not weary—

Last at the knocker and first at the bell,

Then on divinest tiptoe standing

Might He out-spy the lady’s soul.

When He retires, chilled and weary—        

It will be ample time for me;

Patient, upon the steps, until then—

Heart, I am knocking low at Thee!
