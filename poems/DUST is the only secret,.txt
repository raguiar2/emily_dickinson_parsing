DUST is the only secret,

Death the only one

You cannot find out all about

In his native town:

Nobody knew his father,        

Never was a boy,

Hadn’t any playmates

Or early history.

Industrious, laconic,

Punctual, sedate,        

Bolder than a Brigand,

Swifter than a Fleet,

Builds like a bird too,

Christ robs the next—

Robin after robin        

Smuggled to rest!
