AH, Teneriffe!

        Retreating Mountain!

Purples of Ages pause for you,

Sunset reviews her Sapphire Regiment,

Day drops you her red Adieu!        

  

Still, clad in your mail of ices,

Thigh of granite and thew of steel—

Heedless, alike, of pomp or parting,

Ah, Teneriffe!

        I ’m kneeling still.
