I DID not reach thee,

But my feet slip nearer every day;

Three Rivers and a Hill to cross,

One Desert and a Sea—

I shall not count the journey one        

When I am telling thee.

  

Two deserts—but the year is cold

So that will help the sand—

One desert crossed, the second one

Will feel as cool as land.        

Sahara is too little price

To pay for thy Right hand!

  

The sea comes last. Step merry, feet!

So short have we to go

To play together we are prone,        

But we must labor now,

The last shall be the lightest load

That we have had to draw.

  

The Sun goes crooked—that is night—

Before he makes the bend        

We must have passed the middle sea,

Almost we wish the end

Were further off—too great it seems

So near the Whole to stand.

  

We step like plush, we stand like snow—        

The waters murmur now,

Three rivers and the hill are passed,

Two deserts and the sea!

Now Death usurps my premium

And gets the look at Thee.
