TITLE divine is mine

The Wife without

The Sign.

Acute degree

Conferred on me—        

Empress of Calvary.

Royal all but the

Crown—

Betrothed, without the swoon

God gives us women        

When two hold

Garnet to garnet,

Gold to gold—

Born—Bridalled—

Shrouded—        

In a day

Tri-Victory—

  “My Husband”

Women say

Stroking the melody,        

Is this the way?
