i never told the buried gold

Upon the hill that lies,

I saw the sun, his plunder done,

Crouch low to guard his prize.

  

He stood as near, as stood you here,        

A pace had been between—

Did but a snake bisect the brake,

My life had forfeit been.

  

That was a wondrous booty,

I hope ’t was honest gained—        

Those were the finest ingots

That ever kissed the spade.

  

Whether to keep the secret—

Whether to reveal—

Whether, while I ponder        

Kidd may sudden sail—

  

Could a Shrewd advise me

We might e’en divide—

Should a Shrewd betray me—

“Atropos” decide!
