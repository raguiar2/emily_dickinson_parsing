“morning” means “milking” to the farmer

Dawn to the Apennines—

Dice to the Maid.

“Morning” means just Chance to the Lover—

Just Revelation to the Beloved.        

Epicures date a breakfast by it!

Heroes a battle,

The Miller a flood,

Faint-going eyes their lapse

From sighing,        

Faith, the Experiment of our Lord!
