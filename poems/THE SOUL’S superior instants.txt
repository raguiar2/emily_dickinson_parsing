THE SOUL’S superior instants

  Occur to Her alone,

When friend and earth’s occasion

Have infinite withdrawn.

  

Or she, Herself, ascended        

To too remote a height,

For lower recognition

Than Her Omnipotent.

  

This mortal abolition

Is seldom, but as fair        

As Apparition—subject

To autocratic air.

  

Eternity’s disclosure

To favorites, a few,

Of the Colossal substance        

Of immortality.
