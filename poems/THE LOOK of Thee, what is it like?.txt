THE LOOK of Thee, what is it like?

Hast thou a hand or foot,

Or mansion of Identity,

And what is thy Pursuit?

  

Thy fellows,—are they Realms or Themes?        

Hast thou Delight or Fear

Or Longing,—and is that for us

Or values more severe?

  

Let change transfuse all other traits,

Enact all other blame,        

But deign this least certificate—

That thou shalt be the same.
