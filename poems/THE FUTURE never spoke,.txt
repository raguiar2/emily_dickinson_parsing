the future never spoke,

Nor will he, like the Dumb,

Reveal by sign or syllable

Of his profound To-come.

But when the news be ripe,        

Presents it in the Act—

Forestalling preparation

Escape or substitute.

Indifferent to him

The Dower as the Doom,        

His office but to execute

Fate’s Telegram to him.
